    "    - Charging a (small) fee\n",
    "- **Paper Mill**: Companies or groups that make fake research papers for people with plagiarism or make up results that are not real (fabrication).\n",
    "- **Conference proceedings**:\n",
    "    - Find a good place to publish (venue or outlet like a journal or conference)\n",
