    "### Type I Error:\n",
    "A **Type I error** or **false positive** occurs when a **true null hypothesis** is incorrectly rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: If you're testing whether a new drug is effective and you find a significant result (p-value < 0.05), but the drug actually has no effect, you’ve made a Type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-Test:\n",
    "A **t-test** is a statistical test used to compare the means of two groups and determine whether the differences between them are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Types of t-tests**:\n",
    "  1. **Independent t-test**: Compares means of two independent groups (e.g., comparing test scores between two different classes).\n",
    "  2. **Paired t-test**: Compares means from the same group at two different times (e.g., before and after a treatment).\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-test gives you a **t-statistic**, which you use to determine whether the difference between the two groups is likely due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P-Value:\n",
    "The **p-value** is the probability of observing your data (or something more extreme) under the assumption that the **null hypothesis** is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpreting p-values**:\n",
    "  - A p-value less than a predetermined significance level (often 0.05) suggests that the result is statistically significant, meaning the null hypothesis can be rejected.\n",
    "  - A p-value greater than 0.05 indicates that the evidence is not strong enough to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship Between Type I Error, t-Test, and P-Value:\n",
    "- The **t-test** gives a **p-value** that helps you decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- A **Type I error** occurs when you reject the null hypothesis, but the null hypothesis is actually true. This would happen if you incorrectly interpret a p-value as significant (e.g., p < 0.05) when there is no actual difference."

    "Sure! Let's walk through a full example of a **t-test** and the **p-value** calculation, step by step, using a simple scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "Suppose a researcher wants to test if a new teaching method improves the test scores of students. They have a group of 30 students, and they collect their test scores before and after the new teaching method was implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The mean test score before and after the new method is the same (i.e., the teaching method has no effect).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The mean test score after the new method is different from before (i.e., the teaching method has an effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher performs a **paired t-test** because they are comparing the scores from the same group of students before and after the teaching method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Data:\n",
    "Let’s say the differences between the scores (after - before) for the 30 students are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D = \\{1.2, -0.4, 0.7, 2.5, 1.0, 0.3, -0.5, 1.8, 2.2, -0.3, \\dots \\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences (D) are the result of subtracting the \"before\" scores from the \"after\" scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Calculate the Mean of the Differences (D̄)\n",
    "Let’s calculate the **mean difference** ($\\bar{D}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{D} = \\frac{1.2 + (-0.4) + 0.7 + 2.5 + 1.0 + 0.3 + (-0.5) + 1.8 + 2.2 + (-0.3) + \\dots}{30}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, let's assume the **mean difference** is calculated to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{D} = 0.8\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Calculate the Standard Deviation of the Differences (sᵈ)\n",
    "Next, we need the **standard deviation of the differences** ($s_d$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (D_i - \\bar{D})^2}{n-1}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume the **standard deviation** of the differences comes out to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_d = 1.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Calculate the t-Statistic\n",
    "Now we calculate the **t-statistic** using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{\\bar{D}}{s_d / \\sqrt{n}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\bar{D} = 0.8$ (mean difference),\n",
    "- $s_d = 1.5$ (standard deviation of the differences),\n",
    "- $n = 30$ (sample size).\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute the values into the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{0.8}{1.5 / \\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{0.8}{1.5 / 5.477} = \\frac{0.8}{0.274} \\approx 2.92\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Calculate the p-Value\n",
    "To find the **p-value**, we compare the **t-statistic** (2.92) with a **t-distribution** table (or use statistical software). The **degrees of freedom** (df) for a paired t-test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "df = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a **t-distribution table** or software, you find the **p-value** corresponding to a **t-statistic of 2.92** with 29 degrees of freedom. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume that the **p-value** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p = 0.007\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Interpret the Results\n",
    "Now, compare the **p-value** with your **significance level** (often $\\alpha = 0.05$).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If **p < 0.05**, reject the null hypothesis (there is a significant effect).\n",
    "- If **p ≥ 0.05**, fail to reject the null hypothesis (no significant effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p = 0.007 < 0.05\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we **reject the null hypothesis** and conclude that the new teaching method **significantly improves** the test scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Formulas:\n",
    "- **Mean of Differences**: $\\bar{D} = \\frac{\\sum D_i}{n}$\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation of Differences**: $s_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (D_i - \\bar{D})^2}{n-1}}$\n",
    "- **t-Statistic**: $t = \\frac{\\bar{D}}{s_d / \\sqrt{n}}$\n",
    "- **p-value**: The probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as the one computed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "In this example, after calculating the t-statistic and p-value, we found that the new teaching method had a significant effect on the students' test scores (since $p = 0.007$ is less than 0.05). Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected."
