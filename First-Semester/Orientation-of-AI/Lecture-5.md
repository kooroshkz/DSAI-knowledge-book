# Intentionality
Our observation of the world let's us create a faux understanding of how objects should behave.  
A physical stance is using previous experiences to determine and predict how things should occur, a design stance is using our faux understanding of the world to assume the purpose of objects and using that to predict how it should behave.  
The intentional stance, you treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent, then you figure out what the beliefs of the agent should have given its place in the world and its purpose, then you figure out what desires it should have using the same considerations and you can finally predict that this rational agent will act to get closer to its goals that are connected to its beliefs.

## What is intentionality
It is the capacity of a system to be about something.  
An intentional system is signaled by feeling appropriate about using everyday cognitive verbs. (For example hate, love, thinks, etc...)  
The closer the intentional system is to a human, the easier it is to feel appropriate giving it a feeling of cognition.  
Intentionality is not the same as being capable of intending. Intentionality is an umbrella term for many things including desires, beliefs, ..., and intentions. The similarity between philosophical intentionality and intentions is almost purely linguistic. (Might be questions about in the exam, understand slides, explanations, and reading materials)

## Attribution of intentionality
It is the belief that intentionality is something we attribute as an outsider to a system to make sense of how it will behave. There is a question of whether or not it is appropriate to consider giving an AI intentionality.  
Having a human (and I assume other animals) like face has a significant effect on how much intentionality we give to the object.

## Intentional stance $>>$ Theory of mind
Taking the intentional reasoning stance is similar to applying theory of mind, if you look theory of mind online you'd find many results.  
Theory of mind is figuring out other peoples mental states, however it is a process that is full of uncertainties. It has an additional complexity through recursive intentionality, would the intentions change due to my intentions?

# Creativity
According to Margaret Boden, creativity in a nutshell is an aspect of intelligence, it is the ability to come up with ideas that are new and different from previous ideas. (Unfamiliar or unlikely)  
There are three ways of creativity:
- Combinational creativity by making unfamiliar combinations.
- Explorative creativity by exploring new concepts in an already existing conceptual field.
- Transformative creativity by changing the conceptual field.

## Measuring creativity
How is creativity measured? The classical example is Torrance test of creative thinking which checks the fluency (number of ideas the test subject gives), flexibility (number of categories that the ideas cover), elaboration (level of details for the ideas), and originality (rarity of the ideas given).
