Chapter 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**

---

#### **Types of AI Approaches:**

| **Thinking Humanly**| **Thinking Rationally**|
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "make computers think in literal sense." "human thinking" | "mental faculties through computational models.", "The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act."|
| **Acting Humanly**| **Acting Rationally**|
| "machines that perform functions performed by people." "make computers do things people aren't better." | "Computational Intelligence, design of intelligent agents." intelligent behavior in artifacts."|


**Total Turing Test:** Adds physical interaction (vision, robotics).


#### **Four Approaches to AI**
1. **Acting Humanly:**
   - Turing Test capabilities:
     - Natural language processing.
     - Knowledge representation.
     - Automated reasoning.
     - Machine learning.
2. **Thinking Humanly:**
   - Cognitive modeling through introspection, experiments, and imaging.
   - Example: GPS (General Problem Solver) mimicked human thought patterns.
3. **Thinking Rationally:**
   - Formal logic, syllogisms (e.g., Aristotle).
   - Limitations: Translating real-world problems to formal logic can be hard.
4. **Acting Rationally:**
   - Rational agents take actions to maximize expected outcomes.
   - Broader than just inference and includes reflex actions.

## **Notes:**
- AI will never reach higher IQ level than humans due lack of consciousness, creativity, and emotions.
- Reflex actions (Flinching from a hot stove) are **not rational** as they bypass conscious deliberation. They are also **not intelligent** as got pre-programmed biological responses.
- We study the problem of building agents with **Rational Action** that are intelligent in this sense.
- Psychologists adopted the idea that humans and animals can be considered information-processing machines.
