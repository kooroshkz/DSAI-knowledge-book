### Quantifying Uncertainty

**Joint Probability Distribution**:
   - Describes probabilities for all combinations of random variables.

### **Applications of Bayes' Rule**
1. **Bayes' Rule**:
   - $ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(a \land b)}{P(b)} $, where $ P(B) \neq 0 $.

### **Practical Considerations**

Frequentists rely only on data, while Bayesians incorporate prior beliefs and update them with evidence.
