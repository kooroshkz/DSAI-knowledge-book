### Spatial Interaction
**Proxemics**: The study of personal space in social interactions. Four zones:
   - **Intimate Distance** (< 0.5m): Close relationships.
   - **Personal Distance** (0.5m–1.2m): Friends and relatives.
   - **Social Distance** (1.2m–3.7m): Acquaintances.
   - **Public Distance** (> 3.7m): Strangers, public speaking.

**Robot Navigation**:
   - **SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping)**: Used by robots to map environments and avoid obstacles.
   - **Social Navigation**: Robots must move in ways that are comfortable and predictable for humans (e.g., legible motion of robot arms in collaborative tasks).

**Social Signals and Positioning**:
   - Robots can use motion trajectories to convey intent (e.g., slow movements in social zones to signal availability).
   - Inadvertent social cues from purely functional navigation (e.g., a vacuum robot bumping repeatedly) may be perceived as rude.

**Case Study**: **Joggobot** (a drone running companion) demonstrated how different spatial placements affect user experience—chasing the drone was preferred over being followed.
## Verbal Interaction and Dialogue

**Speech and Prosody**:
   - Spoken text has less structure but more prosody (intonation, stress, tempo).
   - **Prosody** adds meaning (e.g., stressing different words in a sentence changes its meaning).
   - Robots often struggle with using prosody effectively, making verbal interactions difficult.

### Basic Techniques:
**Text to Speech (TTS)**
**Interpretation with Large Language Models (LLMs)**

**Dialogue Management (DM)**:
   - Manages the flow of conversation, turn-taking, and the dialogue state.
   - **Dimensions of DM**:
     - **Openness vs. Closeness**: Flexibility of the conversation.
     - **User vs. System Initiative**: Who controls the flow.
     - **Linearity**: Whether the conversation follows a script or can evolve.
