## **Non-verbal Multimodal Interaction: Social Signal Processing (SSP)**

### Key Concepts
- **Social Signal Processing (SSP)**: A field combining social psychology, affective sciences, machine learning, and robotics to understand and generate non-verbal behaviors in machines for human interaction.

### Components of SSP
1. **Behavioral Cues**: Short-term, observable actions (e.g., nodding, smiling, raising voice).
2. **Behavior**: Longer-term patterns of cues (e.g., nodding and smiling signal agreement).
3. **Social Signals**: Cues or behaviors that convey social meaning (e.g., dominance, warmth, competence).


### Functions of Social Signals
1. **Interpersonal Stance**: Communicate warmth, competence, dominance.
2. **Interaction Coordination**: Turn-taking, conflict resolution, negotiations.
3. **Affective State**: Convey emotions like happiness, anger, or surprise.

### Moderators of Social Signals
- **Individual Moderators**: Personality traits (OCEAN model), gender, physical state.
- **Group Moderators**: Group size, roles, and settings (e.g., in-group vs. out-group).

### Social Signal Processing Pipeline
1. **Machine Analysis**: Detect and classify behavioral cues (e.g., posture, voice) into signals (e.g., dominance, anger).
2. **Machine Synthesis**: Generate and render appropriate behaviors in response (e.g., lower voice to de-escalate conflict).
