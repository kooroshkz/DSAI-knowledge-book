### Chapter 8: How People Perceive Robots

### 8.2 Anthropomorphism
- **Psychological Anthropomorphism** (Epley et al., 2007): Extends beyond physical appearance, focusing on cognitive and motivational factors that cause us to attribute human traits to robots.
  - **Effectance motivation**: Desire to understand the robot's behavior as a social actor.
  - **Sociality motivation**: People who feel lonely are more likely to anthropomorphize robots.
  - **Elicited agent knowledge**: Using knowledge of social interactions to understand robots.
- **Process of Anthropomorphization**: Initial snap judgments about human-likeness, followed by more deliberate evaluations as familiarity with the robot increases.

### 8.3 Measuring Anthropomorphization
- **Explicit Measures**: Self-report scales like the **Godspeed Questionnaire** and the **Robotic Social Attributes Scale (RoSAS)**, which measure perceptions of warmth, competence, agency, and experience.
- **Implicit Measures**: Reaction times, language use, and neurophysiological measures used to assess subtle behaviors and perceptions.

### 8.4 Consequences of Anthropomorphism
- **Trust in Robots**
- **Robot Acceptance**: The **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)** and the **Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)** are commonly used frameworks for assessing robot acceptance.
- **Likability of Robots**: Likability is affected by human-likeness, emotional cues, and robot movement. Moriâ€™s **Uncanny Valley** theory suggests a drop in likability when a robot is almost, but not quite, human.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Anthropomorphism and Dehumanization**: Dehumanization of humans is the opposite of anthropomorphization, where people attribute fewer human-like traits to out-groups or non-human entities.
