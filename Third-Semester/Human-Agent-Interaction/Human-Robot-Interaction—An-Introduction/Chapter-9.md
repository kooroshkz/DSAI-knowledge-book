### Chapter 9: Emotion

#### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Difference between Affect, Emotion, and Mood**
  - **Affect**: Broad term that includes all emotional responses, from quick, automatic reactions to longer-lasting moods.
  - **Emotions**: Short-term, intense reactions to specific events or people, like feeling angry when pushed in line. They help us prepare for quick responses and affect our interactions.
  - **Moods**: More long-lasting and vague, often without a clear cause, like feeling anxious while waiting for test results or happy after a relaxing weekend.

#### Emotions in Interaction
- **Emotion Models**:
  - **Ekman’s Six Basic Facial Expressions**: Universally recognized facial cues for emotions across cultures (anger, happiness, etc.).
  - **Russell’s Circumplex Model**: Emotions placed on a 2D spectrum of arousal and valence.
  - **OCC Model**: Cognitive framework to describe how emotions are generated in response to different stimuli. It organizes emotions based on **valenced reactions** to three main categories:
    - **Consequences of Events**: Emotions are generated by how we evaluate the outcomes of events, particularly whether the events align with or oppose our goals. For example, we feel **joy** when something good happens to us and **distress** when something bad happens.
   
    - **Actions of Agents**: This category relates to how we judge the actions of others (or ourselves). Emotions like **admiration** or **anger** arise based on whether we perceive these actions as praiseworthy or blameworthy.

    - **Aspects of Objects**: This relates to our emotional responses to the characteristics or properties of objects, such as **liking** or **disliking** a specific item or feature.

### Facial feedback hypothesis

Facial movement influences the emotions we experience. Expressing emotions does not just inform others on how you feel—it, may actually inform you on how you feel.
