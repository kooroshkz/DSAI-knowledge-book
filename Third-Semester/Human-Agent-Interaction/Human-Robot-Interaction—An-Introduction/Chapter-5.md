### **Importance of Spatial Interaction**
- Robots must manage **space** in relation to humans to ensure socially acceptable behavior.
- **Proxemics**: The study of how people use space in social interactions.

### **Human Proxemics**
- **Edward T. Hall's Four Zones of Distance**:
  - **Intimate Distance**: <0.5m, close relationships.
  - **Personal Distance**: 0.5–1.2m, friends or close acquaintances.
  - **Social Distance**: 1.2–4m, acquaintances or group settings.
  - **Public Distance**: >4m, formal settings or strangers.
- Cultural differences in proxemics, e.g., **high-contact cultures** (South America) versus **low-contact cultures** (U.S.).

### **Group Spatial-Interaction Dynamics**
- **F-formations** (Kendon, 1990): Group dynamics based on positioning.
  - **O-space**: Central interaction space within a group.
  - **P-space**: Space people occupy.
  - **R-space**: Area surrounding the group.
  - Different formations: face-to-face, L-shape, side-by-side, circular.

### **Spatial Interaction for Robots**
- **Robot Localization**:
  - **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping): Robots use sensors (cameras, LiDAR) to map the environment.
- **Social Navigation**:
  - Techniques like **path-planning** and **dynamic window approach (DWA)** help robots avoid obstacles while planning movements.
  - **Proxemics** in HRI: Studies show people prefer robots to stay within social or personal distance zones.

---

### **Socially Appropriate Positioning**
- **Proxemic behaviors**: Robots must anticipate human movements and maintain a comfortable distance.
- In **group interactions**: maintaining F-formations
- **Legible motion**: When a robot approaches or interacts, its actions must be easily understood by humans.

### **Conveying Robot Intent (Express robot intention)**
- Robot trajectories can be used to signal **intent** (e.g., approaching or moving away from people).
- For handovers, robots should move in ways that make their actions clear and understandable to humans.

### **Key Considerations in Spatial Interaction**
- **Cultural differences**
- **Context awareness**
- **Safety and Comfort**
