### **Chapter 13 - The Future**

**Technological Developments in AI and HRI**  
- Current human-robot interactions (HRI) are often assisted by **Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ)** methods where humans operate robots.

## Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ)

In WoZ experiments, the robot’s behavior (speech, movements, responses) is typically controlled remotely by a human operator, but the participants believe the robot is acting on its own. This method is useful for testing interactions and designs before the technology is fully functional for:
- Testing future possibilities
- Realistic interaction
- AI limitations

**Crystal Ball Problems**  
- Predicting the future of HRI is difficult, with grand promises like **Tesla’s Optimus humanoid** yet to be realized.
- There's uncertainty about what people will actually want from robots, as past predictions often led to false expectations (e.g., strong AI predictions).
- HRI will evolve with a mix of technological progress and social needs that we can't fully anticipate.


**Attitudes Toward Robots**: Public is generally positive about using robots for hard tasks but more reserved about social and companion (Company in life) robots.
## Technology is mainly holding back HRI:

The development of smart materials
