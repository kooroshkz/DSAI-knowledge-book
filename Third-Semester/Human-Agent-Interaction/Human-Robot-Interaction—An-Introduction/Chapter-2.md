### **Definition and Scope of HRI**:
   - **HRI** focuses on how humans and robots interact, especially with **social robots**, which differ from traditional robots designed for physical tasks.
   - Key characteristics of social robots include:

      - **Embodiment:** They often have humanlike features (e.g., eyes, a face).
         - **Embodiment** of a robot (e.g., having eyes, a mouth) influences human interaction and expectations.
      - **Social skills:** Eye contact, following conversation norms, or recognizing emotions.
      - **Influence on human perception:** Their design and appearance (e.g., eyes imply the robot can see).
         - Humanlike features trigger people to treat robots as social beings, but this can lead to frustration if robots don’t meet expectations.


**Isaac Asimov** who introduced early ideas about robot-human relationships in 1940 where these ideas were initially part of science fiction
  - **Kismet (1997 MIT)**: One of the first social robots to exhibit emotions and reactions based on input.
  - **Nao, Pepper, Paro, Baxter, Cozmo**: Important robots for research in HRI, each with different functions (e.g., therapy, industrial work, social interaction).
   
### **HRI vs HCI**:
   - **HRI (Human-Robot Interaction)** focuses on interactions between **humans and physically embodied robots**, dealing with both social and physical interactions, often requiring robots to understand human social cues and norms.

   - **HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)** focuses on interactions between **humans and computers** (typically non-embodied systems), primarily involving software, interfaces, and digital environments without the complexities of social embodiment.

### Key Landmarks:
   - **ASIMO**: A humanoid robot by Honda, represents early advancements in physical robot capabilities.
   - **Nao**: A humanoid research platform widely used in HRI.
   - **Pepper, Paro, Keepon**: Different forms of robots used for social purposes, ranging from customer service to therapeutic roles.
   - **InMoov**: Open-source social robot (2012–present) built with rapid prototyping and accessible components.
   - **Blossom**: Open-source tensile robot (2019–present) that can be handcrafted and customized.
The first mention of “social robot” was in 1935 for a cold behaved person and in 1978 in context of Robotics.
