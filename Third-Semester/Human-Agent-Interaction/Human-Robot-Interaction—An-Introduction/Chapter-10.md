### Study Notes: Chapter 10 - Research Methods in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

**HRI Research** is Robot-centered (technical capabilities) and user-centered (human behavior and cognition) and **Iterative Design** (Combines robot- and user-centered approaches by testing and refining robot prototypes based on user feedback.)

**Defining Research Questions:**
   - **Exploratory vs. Confirmatory Research:**
     - *Exploratory:* Aims to uncover new insights without predefined hypotheses (e.g., how people interact with a robot over time).
     - *Confirmatory:* Tests specific hypotheses (e.g., whether a robot’s design affects user behavior).

   - **Correlation vs. Causation:**
     - *Correlation:* Identifies patterns but does not determine cause (e.g., survey studies).
     - *Causation:* Requires experimental manipulation to establish a cause-effect relationship (e.g., randomized control trials).
     - *Spurious correlation:* Correlation without Causation

     - *Correlation:* Identifies patterns but does not determine cause (e.g., survey studies).
     - *Causation:* Requires experimental manipulation to establish a cause-effect relationship (e.g., randomized control trials).
     - *Spurious correlation:* Correlation without Causation

**Study Types:**
   - **User Studies:** Involve participants interacting with robots under controlled experimental conditions.
   - **Survey Studies:** Use questionnaires to gather data on attitudes and behaviors.
   - **System Studies:** Evaluate the robot's technical performance, often without human participants.
   - **Observational Studies:** Examine natural HRI in real-world settings without direct manipulation.
   - **Ethnographic Studies:** Long-term observation of HRI in specific contexts to understand broader sociocultural implications.

**Research Designs:**
   - **Between-Subjects Design:** Different groups experience different conditions (e.g., comparing two robot types).
   - **Within-Subjects Design:** Same participants experience all conditions, reducing variability but introducing potential bias (e.g., participants interacting with multiple robots).
   - **Sample Size:** Determined by the effect size you are trying to detect; smaller samples may be used in case studies or when studying specific populations.

**Special Considerations:**
   - **Field vs. Lab Studies:** Lab studies control variables but lack ecological validity. Field studies observe naturalistic HRI, offering real-world insights but less control.
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Studies:** Short-term studies often focus on first interactions (novelty effect), while long-term studies observe evolving relationships with robots.
   - **Convenience Sample**: Participants selected based on their availability and ease of access rather than random selection. While it’s **quick and easy**, it can introduce bias because the sample may not represent the larger population well. This can affect the **generalizability** of the study results.

#### Variables:

-  Independent Variables (IV)
   - **Definition**: The variable that the experimenter **manipulates or changes** to observe its effect.
   - **Purpose**: To see how changes in the IV influence the outcome.
   - **Example**: In a study testing how sleep affects productivity, the **number of hours of sleep** is the independent variable.

- Dependent Variables (DV)
   - **Definition**: The variable that the experimenter **measures**. It is the outcome or the result influenced by the independent variable.
   - **Purpose**: To see how it responds to changes in the independent variable.
   - **Example**: In the same study, **productivity** (e.g., tasks completed) is the dependent variable because it depends on how much sleep was provided.

### Key Idea:
- The **independent variable** causes changes.
- The **dependent variable** shows the effects.

**Controlled studies** allow researchers to manipulate an independent variable and observe its effect on a dependent variable, while controlling for other factors. This setup is essential for establishing **causal relationships**(ٌWhen something is the cause for the other.).


**HRI Metrics and Data Reporting:**
   - **Qualitative Data Analysis:** Requires coding schemes and thematic analysis to interpret behaviors and interactions.
   - **Quantitative Data:** Involves statistical methods to test hypotheses (e.g., ANOVA, regression).
   - **Data Verification:** Use attention-check questions and appropriate statistical controls to ensure data quality (especially in crowdsourced studies).
### 10.8 Standards for Statistical Analysis

- **Core Elements**: Tendency (mean), variability (spread), and sample size are key factors in statistical tests, which generate p-values.
- **NHST**: Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) uses the **p-value** to check if results are statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05).
- **Errors**: Type I error (false positive) occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly rejected, while Type II error (false negative) happens when a real effect is missed.
- **Effect Size**: A small p-value doesn't always mean a large effect, so effect size is crucial for context.

### P-value
A **p-value** tells you how likely it is that your results happened by chance. If the p-value is **0.05** or less, it means there's a 5% or smaller chance that the result occurred randomly. Scientists use this to decide if their findings are meaningful or just due to random variation. If the p-value is below 0.05, the result is considered **statistically significant**.
