#### **Types of Nonverbal Interaction:**

1. **Gaze and Eye Movement**

2. **Gesture**:
   - Gestures include **deictic (pointing)**, **iconic (illustrating)**, **symbolic (waving)**, and **beat (emphasizing)** movements.
   - Robots can use gestures to **enhance communication**, making interactions more **anthropomorphic** and **engaging**.

3. **Mimicry and Imitation**:
   - **Mimicry** (unconscious) and **imitation** (conscious) help build rapport and signal **positive interactions**.

4. **Touch**:
   - Examples include therapy robots like **Paro**, which reduce stress through tactile interaction.

5. **Posture and Movement**:
   - Body **posture** can signal **emotions** and **engagement** (e.g., upright posture for positivity, drooping for sadness).

6. **Rhythm and Timing**:
   - **Timing** of nonverbal cues, like gaze or gestures, is essential for **synchronized** interactions (turn-taking, dancing, etc.).
   - A robot that mirrors human rhythms during interactions appears more **lifelike** and **engaged**.
### 1. **Impression Formation**:
   - **Dual-process models** explain how we process information: 
     - **System 1 (Snap judgments)** (automatic, quick, intuitive) forms instant impressions based on prior experiences or cues.
     - **System 2** (deliberate, slow) involves more conscious thought but still influenced by personal biases.
   - **First impressions** of robots are influenced by prior knowledge (e.g., sci-fi movies or friendly experiences).
   - People form quick, **automatic judgments** about robots (System 1). then if motivated, they may engage in more **deliberate thinking** (System 2), which can modify their initial judgment.
   
### 2. **Anthropomorphism**:
   - **Epley’s Theory (2007)** explains three factors that drive anthropomorphism:
     1. **Effectance Motivation**: Need to make sense of robots leads to seeing them as humanlike, especially in unfamiliar situations and helps people reduce stress in new situations by treating robots like humans.
     2. **Sociality Motivation**: Loneliness or lack of human connection makes people more likely to anthropomorphize robots.
     3. **Elicited Agent Knowledge**: People apply human social norms to robots, expecting humanlike behavior.
   - The **process** of anthropomorphization involves **snap judgments** (System 1) and **deliberate processing** (System 2), which can change with experience.

The **CASA (Computers as Social Actors)** approach shows that people treat machines, like computers and robots, as if they were social beings, applying human-like traits and norms. Initially focused on computers, it was later applied to social robots.

**Złotowski et al. (2018)** extended this with a **dual-process model** for anthropomorphizing robots:
1. **Automatic processing**: Quick, intuitive reactions where people instantly attribute human-like qualities.
2. **Controlled processing**: Deliberate evaluation where people consciously judge a robot's human-likeness.

This model explains how people form and refine their impressions of robots over time.

### 3. **Measuring Anthropomorphization**:
   - **Explicit measurements** include scales like **mind perception** (agency and experience), **warmth** and **competence** scales, and the **Godspeed questionnaire**.
   - **Implicit measurements** focus on indirect behaviors like reaction times or applying human social norms (e.g., personal space) to robots.

### 4. **Consequences of Anthropomorphism**:
   - **Trust**
   - **Acceptance**: Models like **TAM (Technology Acceptance Model)** and **UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology)** predict user acceptance of robots based on factors like **usefulness**, **ease of use**, and **social influences**.
   - **Liking**: Anthropomorphism can increase likability, but **uncanny valley effects** (when a robot is almost humanlike but not quite) can reduce likability.

- **TAM** is suitable for testing **individual robot-user interactions**.
- **UTAUT** is better for evaluating robots in **social or group settings**.
- Both models can be used, depending on which aspects of **user acceptance** Miciah wants to assess.

### 5. **Social Judgments and Key Dimensions**:
   - **Warmth**: The perception of the robot being friendly, good-natured, or approachable.
   - **Competence**: How capable or skilled the robot is perceived to be in completing tasks or goals.

These dimensions are core aspects of **social cognition** used to judge both humans and robots.
