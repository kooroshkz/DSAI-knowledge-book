### Hardware in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

1. **Types of Robots**:
   - **Social Robots** (e.g., Keepon, Jibo): Focus on communication and expression.
   - **Mobile Robots** (e.g., Roomba, Spot): Designed for navigation, mapping, and mobility.
   - **Industrial Robots**
   - **Telepresence Robots** (e.g., Double, Kubi): Enable remote communication.

2. **Hardware Components**:
   - **Sensors**: Detect distance, vision, sound, and touch (e.g., infrared sensors, cameras, microphones).
   - **Actuators**: Enable movement (motors, wheels, legs, pneumatic actuators).
   - **Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: The range of motion available to a robot (e.g., 6 DOF for industrial arms).

3. **Distance Sensors**:
   - **Ultrasonic**: Measures time for sound to bounce back.
   - **Infrared**: Detects angle of reflected infrared light.
   - **LiDAR**: Measures time for laser pulses to return.


### Design Affordances
- **Affordances (Gibson, 2014)**: Organisms perceive their environment based on action potential (e.g., a rock can be thrown or hidden behind).
- **Design Affordances (Norman, 2008)**: Designers make affordances explicit by shaping the appearance and behavior of objects to support human-robot interaction (HRI).

### Design Patterns
- **Design Patterns (Alexander, 1977)**: Reusable solutions to common design problems, structured in problem-solution pairs.
- **Software Engineering Patterns (Gamma et al., 1994)**: A catalog of patterns for reusable object-oriented software.
- **HRI Design Patterns (Kahn et al., 2008)**: Social design patterns, e.g., “Initial Introduction,” “In Motion Together,” help manage interaction between humans and robots.

### Design Principles
1. **Matching Form and Function**: A robot's appearance should match its function.
2. **Underpromise and Overdeliver**: Avoid raising unrealistic expectations in users.
3. **Interaction Expands Function**: Open-ended designs allow users to adapt interactions based on personal needs.
4. **Don't Mix Metaphors**: A holistic design approach ensures consistent robot behavior and appearance.

### Design Methods
- **Engineering Design**: Structured process from problem definition to solution testing.
- **Limitations**: HRI problems can be ill-defined, requiring iterative and user-centered approaches.
  
### User-Centered Design (UCD)
- **Involvement of Users**: UCD focuses on end-user needs throughout design (e.g., prototyping and iterative testing).

### Participatory Design
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involving users in decision-making acknowledges their expertise but poses challenges like managing unrealistic expectations.

### Designing for Anthropomorphisation
- **Appearance**: A few simple visual cues (e.g., eyes, a mouth) are enough to evoke human form. Complex features may not always increase anthropomorphism.
- **Robot Types**:
  - **Androids**
  - **Humanoids**
  - **Non-humanoids**
  - **Zoomorphs**

### Designing for Anthropomorphism: Behavior
- **Behavioral Cues**: Robots can be perceived as anthropomorphic through their movements and responses to interaction contexts (e.g., Pepper reacts to sound).
- **Animation Principles**: Principles like "squash and stretch," anticipation, and follow-through can make robot behavior appear more lifelike.

### Measuring Anthropomorphism
- **Godspeed Questionnaire**: Used to evaluate robots based on anthropomorphism, animacy, likability, and perceived intelligence.
- **Behavioral Indicators**: Observing language use, social norms, and proxemics in human-robot interactions.
