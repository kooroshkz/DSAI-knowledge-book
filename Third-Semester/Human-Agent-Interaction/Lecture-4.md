### Evaluation Methods
**Research Question Type**:
   - **Exploratory**: Open-ended (e.g., How do children react to the robot?).
   - **Confirmatory**: Hypothesis-driven (e.g., Children learn math after using the robot).
   
**Outcome Data**:
   - **Qualitative**: Interviews, observations, opinions.
   - **Quantitative**: Surveys, measurements (e.g., distance from robot, test scores).

 **Study Types**:
   - **Case Study**: Detailed analysis of a small group (e.g., children with ADHD).
   - **Classical Experiment**: Controlled studies with independent and dependent variables.
   - **Observational**: Uncontrolled, natural observations (e.g., how people react in public).

**Location Context**:
   - **Lab**: Controlled setting.
   - **Field**: Real-world setting.
   - **Crowd-Sourced**: Remote studies (e.g., MTurk).

**Temporal Context**:
   - **Single Session**: One-time interaction.
   - **Repeated**: Multiple sessions.
   - **Long-Term**: Extended interactions over time.

**User Involvement**:
   - **Before Design**: Users provide input.
   - **During Design**: Users shape the design.
   - **After Design**: Users evaluate the robot.

### Analysis Methods
- **Quantitative**: Statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVAs).
- **Qualitative**: Coding, conversation analysis, participant quotes.

### Prototypical HAI Studies
1. **Perception Study**: Evaluating user perception of robot behavior.
2. **Pilot Study**: Testing system robustness and usability.
3. **Impact Study**: Measuring the effect of robot interaction on learning or behavior.
