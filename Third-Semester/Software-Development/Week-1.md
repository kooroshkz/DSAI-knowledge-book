## Evolution of software design techniques
- **Exploratory Style**: Gives complete freedom to the programmer to choose the activities to develop a software system.
- **Structured Style**: It is based on the concept of divide and conquer. It divides the problem into smaller subproblems and solves them.
    - Customrt $\rightarrow$ Initial-Code $\rightarrow$ Test(Bug/Debug) $\rightarrow$ Deliver
- **Control Flow Oriented Style**: It is based on if-then-else and do-while constructs.
    - Problem: Size and complexity of programs kept on increasing.
- **Data Structure Oriented Style**: Design programâ€™s data structures, and then develop the code structure based on the data structure.
- **Data Flow Oriented Style**: It is based on the concept of data flow diagrams (DFDs).
- **Object Oriented Style**: It is based on the concept of objects. An object is a real-world entity that has a state and behavior.
### **Collect Requirements**
- **Studying existing documentation**
- **Interviewing**
- **Task Analysis**
- **Scenario analysis**
- **Form analysis**


### Four Fundamental Activities to Design Software:

1. **Requirement Analysis**
- Requirement Engineering $\rightarrow$ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
    - Functional (Requirements) = What the system does (features) $\rightarrow$ Defined by the customer
    - Non-functional (Requirements) = How it performs (quality) $\rightarrow$ Defined by the developer
2. **Design & Implementation**
- **System Architecture Design:** Defines the high-level structure, identifying components, modules, and interactions to create a system blueprint.
- **( Detailed & UI & DB & Algorithm & Code Architecture )** Design
3. **Software Validation**
4. **Software Evolution**
