### **The 5 Cs of Data Ethics**
These principles guide ethical practices in data science:

1. **Consent**:
   - Users should know and agree to how their data is used.
   - Clarity is essential to ensure informed decisions.

2. **Clarity**:
   - Explain terms and conditions in simple, understandable language.
   - Avoid lengthy, complex legal jargon.

3. **Consistency**:
   - Maintain ethical and fair practices consistently.
   - Build user trust by adhering to policies.

4. **Control**:
   - Users should have control over their data, including options to delete it.

5. **Consequences**:
   - Consider potential consequences, including unintended or harmful outcomes.

#### **Key Principles of Data Science**:
1. **Observe Regulations**:
   - Understand and comply with relevant data protection laws.
   - Know why regulations exist and what they protect.

2. **Respect Privacy**:
   - Ensure personal identifiers (e.g., emails, IDs) remain private and anonymized.

3. **Eliminate Bias**:
   - Use diverse and representative data.
   - Test for bias and error rates among different groups.

4. **Avoid Fabrication or Falsification**:
   - Report only genuine results without manipulating data.

5. **Show Transparency**:
   - Be open about data collection and analysis methods.
   - Obtain informed consent from participants.

6. **Secure Data Collection**:
   - Use secure methods for storing and analyzing data.

7. **Use Algorithms Responsibly**:
   - Test algorithms for fairness and bias.
   - Ensure they are explainable and ethical in use.

8. **Consider Long-Term Impacts**:
   - Evaluate societal implications of algorithms and data use.
   - Avoid perpetuating inequality or privacy risks.

### **Algorithmic Fairness**

#### **Types of Harm**:
1. **Allocation Harm**: Unequal resource distribution (e.g., jobs or loans).
2. **Quality-of-Service Harm**: Models work better for some groups than others (e.g., face detection algorithms).
3. **Stereotyping**: Reinforces harmful or inaccurate stereotypes (e.g., biased search results).

#### **Principles**:
- **Individual Fairness**: Treat similar individuals similarly.
- **Group Fairness**: Ensure equal treatment for different groups.

### **Six Ethical Issues (CNIL Framework)**:
1. **Autonomous Machines**:
   - Delegation of critical decisions to machines raises accountability concerns.
   - Example: Responsibility for accidents by autonomous vehicles.

2. **Bias, Discrimination, and Exclusion**:
   - Algorithms can amplify systemic biases.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Use explainable and transparent algorithms.

3. **Algorithmic Profiling**:
   - Profiling can lead to misuse (e.g., Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2016 elections).

4. **Massive Data Collection**:
   - AI requires large datasets, but this must balance privacy concerns.
   - Example: Non-identifiable datasets in health studies.

5. **Data Quality and Bias**:
   - Poor-quality training data can lead to harmful results.
   - Example: Microsoft's Twitter bot (Tay) was manipulated into producing offensive content.

6. **Human Identity and AI**:
   - Human-machine hybridization raises ethical questions about emotional attachment to robots.
