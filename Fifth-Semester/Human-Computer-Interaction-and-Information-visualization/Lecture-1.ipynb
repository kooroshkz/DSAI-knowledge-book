    "## 🌍 What is HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* It’s about **how humans interact with machines**.\n",
    "* Three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Humans** → with their work, abilities, and limits.\n",
    "  2. **Machines** → with modes of operation, limits, and possibilities.\n",
    "  3. **Interface** → where humans and machines meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Example: pressing a button on your phone (input) → system responds on screen (output).\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Almost **half of software development** is about UI and interaction design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🕰️ Historical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1940s**: Computers like Harvard Mark I – big, heavy, only used by specialists.\n",
    "* **1970s onwards**: PCs and new interaction paradigms arrived → timesharing, networking, graphical displays.\n",
    "* **Today**: Interaction includes handhelds, cloud, VR, robots, touchscreens.\n",
    "* **Paradigms**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 1950s → batch processing\n",
    "  * 1960s → timesharing\n",
    "  * 1970s → networking, email\n",
    "  * 1980s → graphical interfaces\n",
    "  * 1990s → WWW\n",
    "  * Now → ubiquitous computing, VR, robot interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎨 Design & Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computers must be **intuitive, safe, and logical**.\n",
    "* Users shouldn’t need to “think about how to use it.”\n",
    "* Example: operating a car vs. a complex machine → design matters.\n",
    "* Design sits **between technology and human purposes** (bridges the two).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤖 Directions in HCI\n",
    "\n",
    "* Human-robot interaction (e.g., androids like Geminoid in Japan).\n",
    "* Emotional responses and personal relations with machines are becoming real (ethical debates here).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔬 Multi-disciplinary Nature\n",
    "\n",
    "HCI involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Computer Science** (software, systems).\n",
    "* **Psychology** (cognition, learning, social behavior).\n",
    "* **Design** (graphics, instructional).\n",
    "* **Human factors/ergonomics**.\n",
    "* **Anthropology, sociology, AI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 Definitions of HCI\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Practical**: processes and actions through which a human uses and interacts with a computer.\n",
    "2. **Research focus**: design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key elements in definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Human** → single or groups of users.\n",
    "* **Computer** → not just PCs, also embedded systems, large systems.\n",
    "* **Interaction** → dialogue, feedback, tasks, mapping input/output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Key Concept 1: Usability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Usability = how effective, efficient, and satisfying a system is.\n",
    "* **Not** the same as “user-friendly” (too vague).\n",
    "* Measured with **prototyping, evaluation, standards**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Information Visualization (InfoVis)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal**: make complex data understandable and explorable.\n",
    "* **Visualization** = creating images/models to help us think about data.\n",
    "* **InfoVis vs. SciVis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * InfoVis → abstract data (text, stats, networks), designed visual space.\n",
    "  * SciVis → physical/spatial data (3D models, medical scans).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Key Concepts (HCI + InfoVis)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cognetics** (how people think and perceive).\n",
    "* **Affordance** (what actions an object suggests, e.g., a button invites pressing).\n",
    "* **Visibility** (clear options).\n",
    "* **Task abstraction**.\n",
    "* **Usability & evaluation**.\n",
    "* **Prototyping**.\n",
    "* **Data & transformations** (for InfoVis).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Disaster Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1988 Iran Air Flight 655**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * USS Vincennes shot down a plane due to misinterpreting radar displays.\n",
    "  * Problem: poor **information visualization** (clutter, mapping issues).\n",
    "  * Lesson: HCI/InfoVis can literally save lives."
