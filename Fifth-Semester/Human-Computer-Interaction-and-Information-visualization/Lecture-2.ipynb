    "## 🔄 Quick Recap of Lecture 1\n",
    "\n",
    "* HCI = interaction between humans and computers.\n",
    "* History of interaction paradigms.\n",
    "* Disciplines involved: CS, AI, psychology, sociology, design.\n",
    "* InfoVis = visualizing abstract data to help humans understand.\n",
    "* Key concepts: usability, design, affordance, visibility.\n",

    "## 🎯 Core Approach in Lecture 2\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User-Centred Design**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Interfaces should adapt to users, not the other way around.\n",
    "  * Quote (Donald Norman): “Talking to users is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.”\n",
    "* Goal: **optimize human + computer performance together as a system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ Usability (in depth)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Poor interface design leads to**: mistakes, inaccessibility, frustration, low productivity, even system rejection.\n",
    "* **ISO 9126 software quality metrics**: functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, portability.\n",
    "* **Usability definition (Nielsen, 2003)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Ease of use + methods to improve ease-of-use.\n",
    "  * Requires testing with *real users*.\n",
    "* **Usability components**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Learnability** (easy to learn, memorable).\n",
    "  2. **Efficiency/Throughput** (speed, low error rate).\n",
    "  3. **Flexibility** (customizable, suitable for skill level).\n",
    "  4. **Satisfaction** (subjective feelings).\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Usability goals (objective) vs. User experience goals (subjective). Example: safety vs. fun.\n",

    "## 🧠 Human Psychology in HCI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cognitive Psychology basics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Humans process information via **perception → processing → action**.\n",
    "* Input: senses (vision, hearing, touch, etc.).\n",
    "* Processing: reasoning, problem-solving, memory.\n",
    "* Output: actions + emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cognition\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: psychological processes to acquire, organize, and use knowledge.\n",
    "* **Two modes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Experiential (unconscious)** → fast, automatic, little effort.\n",
    "  * **Reflective (conscious)** → slow, deliberate, decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Left/Right Brain (simplified model)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Left: words, logic, sequential tasks.\n",
    "* Right: images, spatial, holistic patterns.\n",
    "  ⚠️ Modern neuroscience says “right-brain vs left-brain people” is a myth — both hemispheres work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗂️ Memory Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sensory memory**: 0.2–2 seconds (raw input buffers: vision, sound, touch).\n",
    "* **Short-term / Working memory (WM)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 20–30 sec with rehearsal.\n",
    "  * Limited capacity → “7±2 chunks” (Miller, 1956) → now thought to be 3–4 items.\n",
    "* **Long-term memory (LTM)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Unlimited, stores semantic (facts, concepts) + episodic (personal events).\n",
    "  * Access depends on refresh, associations, context.\n",
    "  * Represented as semantic networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Human Processor (Card, Moran & Newell, 1983)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3 subsystems**: perceptual, cognitive, motor.\n",
    "* Each has cycle times (perception \\~100ms, cognition \\~70ms, motor \\~70ms).\n",
    "* Implication: human capacity is limited → designers must simplify, chunk, reduce overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Psychological Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Closure** → people want to finish tasks to free working memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: ATM or online payment must be short + clear.\n",
    "* **Attitude & Anxiety** → negative feelings reduce memory capacity and slow learning.\n",
    "* **Control** → beginners want guidance; experts want speed + control.\n",
    "* **Recognition vs Recall** → easier to recognize than recall. Use menus, icons, chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 👀 Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: focusing on one thing while ignoring others.\n",
    "* **Types**: orienting, expecting, searching, filtering.\n",
    "* **Cocktail party effect**: filtering background noise, but reacting when hearing your name.\n",
    "* **Locus of attention**: humans can only have **one main focus at a time**.\n",
    "* **Implication for UI**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Structure information (chunking, grouping).\n",
    "  * Use spatial/temporal cues.\n",
    "  * Highlight with color, flashing, sounds, or icons.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Cognitive Processing & Meaningfulness\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automated processing** (fast, unconscious).\n",
    "* **Controlled processing** (slow, conscious).\n",
    "* **Meaningful information** is remembered better.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Familiar, imageable, contextual words help (e.g., “Sleep” vs. “Evaluate”).\n",
    "* Other influences: **culture (color meanings), context, emotional state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 😊 Emotion in Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Theories**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * James-Lange: emotion = interpretation of body response.\n",
    "  * Cannon: emotion = direct psych response.\n",
    "  * Schachter-Singer: emotion = body response + situation context.\n",
    "* **Affect**: biological response that influences performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Positive → more creativity, easier problem-solving.\n",
    "  * Negative → slower, narrower thinking.\n",
    "* **Design implication**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Stress makes tasks harder.\n",
    "  * Aesthetically pleasing, rewarding UIs increase positive affect → more tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Review Highlights (Lecture 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory models (sensory, STM/WM, LTM).\n",
    "* Model Human Processor.\n",
    "* Closure, user attitude, anxiety, control.\n",
    "* Recognition > recall.\n",
    "* Focus and attention (orienting, filtering, cocktail party effect).\n",
    "* Cognitive aids (chunking, grouping, color).\n",
    "* Emotion affects interaction design (positive = creative, negative = error-prone).\n"
