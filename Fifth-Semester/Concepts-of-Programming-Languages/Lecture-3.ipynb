    "### Important terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lexeme**: The smallest meaningful unit in the source code. Example: `if`, `x`, `42`, `+` are all lexemes.\n",
    "* **Token**: A **category** or **type** that groups lexemes. Example:\n",
    "  * `if` → keyword token\n",
    "  * `x` → identifier token\n",
    "  * `42` → number token\n",
    "  * `+` → operator token\n",
    "* **Lexer** or **Scanner**: Program does lexical analysis, reads source code and produces tokens.\n",
    "  * **Regular Expressions (Regex) Lexer**: Write rules like:\n",
    "   * identifiers = `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`\n",
    "   * numbers = `[0-9]+`\n",
    "     Then, a program uses these rules to recognize tokens.\n",
    "  * **Finite State Machine (FSM) Lexer**: Build a machine with states and transitions that recognize valid tokens step by step (like following a flowchart of character inputs).\n",
    "  \n",
    "### **Syntax Analysis**\n",
    "After lexical analysis, the **parser** takes a sequence of tokens (from the lexer) and tries to build a structure (parse tree) using those grammar rules. e.g.:\n",
    "```C\n",
    "int x = 42;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tokens: `int`, `x`, `=`, `42`, `;` then *parser* check if it fits grammar rule like `Statement → Type Identifier '=' Number ';'`, then builds a parse tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parsing strategies:\n",
    "* **Top-Down Parsing**: Start from the root of the parse tree and try to build it down to the leaves (tokens).\n",
    "* **Bottom-Up Parsing**: Start from the tokens and try to build up to the root of the parse tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Parsing as Graph Search\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parsing** = build structure (parse tree) from tokens using grammar.\n",
    "2. **Naive BFS** → explores all possibilities → exponential growth.\n",
    "3. **Prefix test** → cut branches if they don’t match target string’s prefix.\n",
    "4. **Leftmost derivation** = always expand the leftmost non-terminal first.\n",
    "   * Makes search systematic.\n",
    "5. **BFS + Leftmost + Prefix test** → faster, fewer branches.\n",
    "6. **Problem**: Some grammars still blow up (too many useless branches)."
